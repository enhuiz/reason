<h1>Reason: A Shell for Research Papers</h1>
</div>

- Did I ever read this paper?
- Which OSDI 2021 papers did I read?
- Which ones have the word 'Distributed' in their titles?
- How many papers in 2020 were co-authored by Professor Mosharaf Chowdhury?

Well, ask `reason`.

## How it works

### Filter and list papers

```
$ reason
>> # Show all papers.
>> ls

## `printf`

`printf` will create an HTML book from your notes.

![printf](/examples/printf.png)

## Commands

Invoking `reason` will start a new command prompt. It accepts unix-like commands that instead work on research papers in your paperbase.

Works now:
- `ls` filters and prints papers in table format. Default columns are title, first author(by1), venue(at), and year(in).
- `cd` adds an AND filter to the default set of filters (which is empty upon startup).
- `pwd` shows the current default filter set by `cd`.
- `touch` creates a new entry in your paperbase.
- `curl` imports papers from the web, e.g. arXiv or usenix.org. It also downloads paper PDFs if available. Also experimentally supports downloading raw PDF urls and inferring metadata fields.
- `rm` removes entries from your paperbase.
- `set` sets attributes of papers.
- `printf` creates an HTML page of your notes using `mdbook`.
- `open` opens the paper with Zathura.
- `ed` opens your editor (defaulting to `vim` but abiding by `$EDITOR`), in which you can edit your notes.
- `man` plus a command will print documentation for that command.
- `exit` or Ctrl-d quits `reason`.

Not yet, but hopefully soon:
- `grep` returns a list of papers whose notes contain the query string that you specify.
- `sort` sorts papers by given columns.
- `stat` prints the metadata and notes of papers.
- `top` prints out a summary of your paperbase.
- `sync` stores the paper metadata state to disk. (Changes are kept in memory and are committed to disk on exit.)

## Installation

You can grab binaries from Releases, or you can run `cargo install reason-shell`.


## Cross-Platform Support

`reason` currently supports Linux and MacOS. Windows is excluded because the owner does not currently own a Windows machine.

In order to share data between multiple platforms, users are encouraged to locate `reason` metadata, PDF files, and markdown notes in a location synced by cloud storage services such as Google Drive. I use the official Google Drive app on MacOS and Insync on Linux. This offers an extra benefit - you can read PDFs with your iPad, also synced with the cloud storage.

## Documentation

If you already have reason, run `man man` to view the top-level documentation.

If you're just exploring whether to use reason, take a look at the [`man`](/man) directory.

## Configuration

The configuration file is kept at `~/.config/reason/config.toml`. If not present, `reason` will generate one populated with default settings.

For more information, open `reason` and run `man config`, or read [`man/config.md`](/man/config.md).
